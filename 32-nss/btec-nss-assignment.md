# Assignments

## Assignment 1: Are we safe ?

#### Assessment Method : Report, Presentation

#### Scenario:
You work for the IT support department of an organisation. The managers have asked for a review of their network security procedures, starting with an overview of current threats and how to protect against them.

Phase 1: an overview of current network security threats and how to protect against them.

* P1: Describe how networks can be attacked.
  * Describe 2 methods in brief using which a network can be attacked.
  * Length: A half page long description at minimum.
  * Evidence: Report containing description.
* D1: Discuss recent network threats.
  * Research and find any 2 network threats that emerged on 2015 or later.
  * Cross-verify the selected network threat with your mentor before starting the assignment.
  * Length: A page long description of each network at minimum.
  * Evidence: Report containing research and description
* P2: Describe how networked systems can be protected [IE2].
  * Provide suggested solutions to the individual threats discussed in D1.
  * Description should be meaningful and to the point.
  * Length: A half page long description at minimum.
  * Evidence: Report containing description.
* M1: Explain the operation of different **Intruder Detection Systems** (IDS).
  * Research and Install a Host Based IDS on your system.
    * Eg: Snort, Suricata, Bro, Kismet, OSSEC, Samhain, OpenDLP
  * Document the process of operation of any IDS selected.
  * Length: A 2 page extensive report describing various operations of an IDS

## Assignment 2: What's best ?

#### Assessment Method : Report, Presentation

#### Scenario:
Following your report on threats, the organisation would now like a presentation on how best to minimise risks.

Phase 2: how to minimise risks.

* P3: Explain what an organisation can do to minimise security breaches in networked systems [SM4].
	* The requirement for P3 is ‘explain’, which should be more than a simple description of the elements outlined in the unit content.

* M2: Suggest how users can be authenticated to gain access to a networked system.
	* For M2, a variety of authentication methods should be explained and one or more recommended for use by the organisation.
* D2: Compare the security benefits of different cryptography techniques.
	* D2 will require some in-depth research into cryptography techniques and a discussion of the relative benefits.s

## Assignment 3: Start installing

#### Assessment Method: Security plan, Observation record, Witness statement, Report

#### Scenario:
The organisation has reviewed their needs and asked you to configure their system appropriately.

Phase 3: configure and test network security hardware/software.

* P4: Plan procedures to secure a network.
* P5: Configure a networked device or specialist software to improve the security of a network.
* M3: Report on the similarities and differences between securing wireless and wired networked systems.
