  - Hand In Date : 16/05/2017
  - Assignment Description
    - The suggested scenario for this assignment is for learners to prepare their evidence as a presentation. The presentation could be in any format eg PowerPoint, web-based or paper-based. Learners do not need to deliver the presentation, although this would provide opportunities to access and practise PLTS.
    - P1 and P2 are straightforward and learners should refer to the detail in the learning outcome (LO) to help decide on the content.
    - P3 will require some research. In this case ‘emerging technologies’ may be considered as any relatively recent network technologies.
    - M1 requires the learner to have given thought to how these emerging technologies have, or may, affect networks. The effects may best be described by use of examples.
    - P4 is also straightforward and the unit content indicates the expected content. For this criterion the verb is ‘explain’, which indicates more than a straightforward description. Including how and why as key questions helps produce an extended answer.
    - For M2 to be awarded, the explanation of fault management should include why it is necessary, the aim and the consequences of failing.
    - D1 requires a justification for carrying out routine performance management activities, which should include aspects related to efficiency and quality standards.
- 2. Managing a Network
  - Criteria covered
    - P5, P6, M3, D2
  - Scenario
    - Undertake network management activities.
  - Assessment method
    - Witness statements
    - Observation records
    - Logs
    - Report
  - Hand Out Date : 16/05/2017
  - Hand In Date : 30/05/2017
  - Assignment Description:
    - This is a practical assignment and will largely be evidenced through witness statements and/or observation records.
    - Learners are required to find out the details of a network configuration for P5. Learners should be able to identify suitable software to interrogate the network and make sense of the results, presenting them in a user- friendly format.
    - For P6, learners should undertake as many as possible of the routine maintenance operations outlined in the unit content. Some of the evidence for this may come from the parallel unit ‘Maintaining computer systems’.
    - Evidence may also come from records/logs of the activities the learner has completed, which must be supplied if M3 is to be awarded.
    - Finally for D2, learners will need to be given a suitable small business scenario to design a management security policy. This should include at least those activities outlined in the unit content.
